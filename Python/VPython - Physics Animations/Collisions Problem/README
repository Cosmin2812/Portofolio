The animation shows two bodies with a wall behind them. 
One of them goes with a given velocity towards the other one, forcing a series of collisions between the second body and the wall.
The program's output is the total number of collisions between the second body and the wall.
The surprising result is that if the first mass is 10 to the power of n (n natural number) times bigger than the second mass, then the number of collisions will be the first n digits of pi.
Example: if the first mass is 100 times bigger, then the total number of collisions would be 31 (first 2 digits of pi).
